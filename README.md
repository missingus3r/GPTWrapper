# GPTWrapper
 GPT Api Chat GUI

 This script is a chatbot gui (wrapper) that uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate responses to user input. The chatbot has a GUI created using the customtkinter library, which allows users to enter their API key and ask the chatbot any type of question. The chatbot is polite and friendly, and responds in a detailed manner to the user's queries by a pre-prompt at the beggining of the chat.
 
 The chatbot works by sending the user's input along with the conversation history to the OpenAI API, which generates a response based on the provided prompt. The response is then displayed in the GUI for the user to read. The chatbot also keeps a record of the conversation history, which is displayed in the chat window along with the user's and bot's messages separated by color.
 
 Also includes error handling to check if the API key entered by the user is valid or not. If the API key is not valid, displays an error message informing the user that the API key is invalid.
 
Overall, this script is a simple and user-friendly gui that uses the state-of-the-art OpenAI API to provide detailed and informative responses to users' questions.
